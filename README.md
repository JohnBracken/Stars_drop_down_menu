# Stars drop down menu

This repository creates a basic webpage that pulls up data
of specific nearby stars using drop down menus to access a 
specific star and the properties of the star.  The star's
properties are displayed on the page after being selected.
The star data was taken from a JSON file and brought
directly into the star parsing script.
